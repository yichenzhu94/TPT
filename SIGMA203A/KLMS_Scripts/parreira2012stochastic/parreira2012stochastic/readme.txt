% The main files to run the first, the second and the third experiment on
% convergence behavior analysis described in
%
% W. D. Parreira, J.-C. M. Bermudez, C. Richard, and J.-Y. Tourneret, "Stochastic
% behavior analysis of the Gaussian kernel-least-mean-square algorithm,"
% IEEE Transactions on signal processing, 2012, vol. 60, n° 5, p. 2208-2222.
%
% are Exp1_conv.m, Exp2_conv.m and Exp3_conv.m
%
% These Matlab files can be directly executed. 
%
% Also included in these three files (See Part I in each file) are conditions
% for convergence of the KLMS algorithm, described in
%
% C. Richard, and J.-C. M. Bermudez, "Closed-form conditions for convergence 
% of the Gaussian kernel-least-mean-square algorithm," Proc. Asilomar conference,
% 2012.
%
% Note that the derivation of these conditions needs the Matlab optimization
% toolbox. If you do not have it, just comment Part 1 in each file.
